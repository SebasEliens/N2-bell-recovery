# Recovery of hidden variable in bipartite Bell scenario

This is Matlab code related to the paper [arxix/2001.11455](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.11455).
It requires NESTA (https://statweb.stanford.edu/~candes/software/nesta/#code) and the NCON function (https://www.tensors.net/code) which are freely available. Some scripts use the kronmult function for efficient multiplication of tensor-product operators, available at https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23606-fast-and-efficient-kronecker-multiplication with a Mathworks account.
